One of the mottos in CoderDojo is 'One Rule, Be Cool', and this is applicable to both mentors and to young people in the Dojo. For volunteers, it is often useful to have a clearer guideline on 'what's cool?' This may vary from Dojo to Dojo but we have created a sample Code of Behaviour for you to use and/or adapt for your Dojo.
